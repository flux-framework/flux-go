# Flux Core Go Bindings

![img/flux-go-banner.png](img/flux-go-banner.png)
![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fluxgrpc)

These will provide common interfaces to interacting with Flux in Go. A Python client is also available to interact with the Go server (example and documentation coming soon).

## Server

This is easiet built outside of the developer environment.

 - [api](cmd/api/api.go) Deploy a flux API service.

```bash
make build
docker run -it ghcr.io/flux-framework/flux-go:latest
```

Or in the [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) environment:

```bash
make server
./bin/flux-grpc-server
```
```console
ü¶©Ô∏è This is the flux service
[GRPCServer] gRPC Listening on [::]:4242
```

## Examples

### Go

These are most easiest built in the [developer container environment](.devcontainer).

```bash
make examples
```

 - [submit](example/submit/submitn.go): Submit a job!
 - [keygen](example/keygen/keygen.go): Use zeromq to generate a curve certificate.
 - [list-jobs](example/list-jobs/list-jobs.go): List jobs example


```console
$ ./bin/flux-submit

$ flux jobs -a

    keygen.hostname = "94dd63b69bfb"

    secret-key = "Vg4o}MV}z7SVzs#f^(o8aLZYx6r-29bLhH&Sva7t"


$ ./bin/flux-list-jobs

  "priority": 16,
  "t_submit": 1739667371.1322868,
  "state": 64
 }
]
```

### Python

We recommend running the service in Go. E.g., in the devcontainer:

```bash
make server
flux start ./bin/flux-grpc-server
```

And then install Python:

```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install -e .
flux grpc -N1 hostname
```
```console
Submit response: 0
```

You could then connect to the broker there and list jobs, etc. We have that endpoint support in the Go binding library so can add to flux grpc as well, if needed. Note that you can also do this same interaction in the provided container:

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/flux-framework/flux-go:python
flux start --test-size=4 flux-grpc-service &
flux grpc -N1 hostname
```
Then use the flux proxy with bash to connect to the running allocation and try `flux jobs -a` to see jobs!

## Development

We provide a [Devcontainer environment](.devcontainer) for use in VScode.
